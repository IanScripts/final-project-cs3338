In snapshot 4 we polish the deployment for demonstration: pin image versions, add health checks, apply restart policies, add .env usage, add .gitignore, tidy Dockerfiles, and document final run instructions. This snapshot is your final deliverable for grading: it looks like a real project.

The following updates include:

Pinned image tags & versions.

Healthcheck sections added to services.

Restart policies.

Environment moved to .env (loaded by compose or Docker).

Volumes & logging clarified.

Services will automatically restart on failure (controlled policy).

Compose uses pinned images so builds are repeatable.

Health checks allow docker compose ps to show service health and help graders see system readiness
