About: The Amber Molecular Dynamics site is a central hub for accessing and learning about the AMBER molecular dynamics software suite. Biomolecular simulation used in computational chemistry and structural biology, It serves as the central resource. It includes downloads, documentation, tools, and community resources for one of the most widely used biomolecular simulation platforms in scientific research. 

📋 What You’ll Find on ambermd.org
The homepage and main sections provide links and resources related to the software:

📥 Downloads
Links to download AmberTools (free, open-source components) and AMBER releases (the main simulation package). 

🛠 Installation
Instructions and guidance on how to install AMBER and related tools on different systems. 

📘 Manuals & Tutorials
Access to user manuals, documentation, and tutorials to help users learn how to set up and run simulations. 

⚙️ Force Fields
Information on the molecular force fields supported by AMBER (these define how atoms interact in simulations). 

🧠 GPU Support & Updates
Resources explaining how to use GPU acceleration for faster simulation runs and details on the latest software updates. 


📬 Mailing Lists & Contacts
Ways to join community mailing lists and reach the developers or support teams. 


📜 History & Contributors
Pages with background on the project’s development history and the many academic contributors involved. 


🧠 How the Software Is Structured
The AMBER software distributed from this site comes in two parts:

AmberTools: A free and open-source toolkit for preprocessing systems, preparing inputs, and analyzing simulation outputs. 

AMBER: The core simulation engine, typically requiring a license for certain uses (but free for academic/nonprofit use with some restrictions).
