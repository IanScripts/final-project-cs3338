During Snapshot 2, the team completed Sprint 1 work in Jira and created the initial QA structure within TestRail. Two test suites were created: an Authentication Suite and a Dashboard UI Suite. Each suite includes multiple test cases based on early project functionality such as logging in and loading the dashboard.

Two TestRail runs were executed. Several tests passed successfully, while two expected failures were observed:

Login with empty password (authentication validation bug)

Dashboard title alignment (UI layout issue)

These failures correspond directly to Sprint 1 Jira bugs (AMWP-10 and AMWP-11). A TestRail Project Summary report was generated and exported for review. Snapshot 2 demonstrates successful setup, execution, and documentation of early QA activities, forming the foundation for further testing in Snapshot 3.
